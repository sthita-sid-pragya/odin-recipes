    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Prep work and browning the meat!

        Roughly dice the onion, and mince as much garlic as you want. I used quite a bit as you can see. :D
        
        Once you've got the veggies prepped, film your sauce pan with olive oil. Heat the pan over medium and cook the ground beef and Italian sausage until browned. If a lot of fat seeps out, drain most of it. You need only a few tablespoons of fat to cook the onion and garlic in.
        
        Once you've drained the extra fat, throw in the onions and garlic.
        
        Stir this around for a few minutes over medium heat until the onions become soft. Then add in a few good pinches of Italian seasoning, a pinch of basil, oregano and salt, and a tablespoon or two of tomato paste.</p>
